# Quick Fix: Testing Smart Claude Modes

## ðŸ”§ The Issue You Found

The script was defaulting to interactive Claude Code CLI in local development, which prompts for file creation permissions. This is the intended behavior for local development, but not for testing the CI/CD headless mode.

## âœ… Fixed: Added --headless Flag

The script now supports three modes:

### **1. Interactive Mode (Default for Local)**
```bash
# Uses full Claude Code CLI with prompts
./scripts/smart-claude.sh "Create a simple Python calculator"
```
**Result:** Prompts for file creation permissions (intended for development)

### **2. Headless Mode (Force Non-Interactive)**
```bash
# Forces Claude Code headless mode with pre-authorized tools
./scripts/smart-claude.sh --headless "Create a simple Python calculator"
```
**Result:** No prompts, creates files automatically (same as GitHub Actions)

### **3. API Mode (Direct API)**
```bash
# Bypasses Claude Code entirely, uses direct API
./scripts/smart-claude.sh --api "Create a simple Python calculator"
```
**Result:** Direct API call with file processing

## ðŸ§ª Test Commands

### **Test Headless Mode (No Prompts)**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
./scripts/smart-claude.sh --headless "Create a simple Python calculator"
```

### **Test GitHub Actions Simulation**
```bash
export GITHUB_ACTIONS="true"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
./scripts/smart-claude.sh "Create a simple Python calculator"
```

### **Test Interactive Mode (With Prompts)**
```bash
# This is what you experienced - normal for local development
./scripts/smart-claude.sh "Create a simple Python calculator"
```

## ðŸ“‹ Mode Selection Logic

| Environment | Auto-Selected Mode | Override Options |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Headless (auto) | None needed |
| **Local + `--headless`** | Headless (forced) | - |
| **Local + `--api`** | API (forced) | - |
| **Local (default)** | Interactive | `--headless` or `--api` |

## âœ… Ready to Test

Now you can test the headless mode that will be used in GitHub Actions:

```bash
# This should create files without prompts
./scripts/smart-claude.sh --headless "Create a simple Python calculator"
```

This matches exactly what happens in GitHub Actions, so it's a perfect test of the CI/CD behavior! ðŸš€
